# Pumpa v0.1

Greetings, fellow pumpkins!

Pumpa is a simple (and yet very unfinished) pump.io client written in
C++ and Qt.  Some parts have been cherry picked from my old StatusNet
client, yaics (<http://gitorious.org/yaics>).

Pumpa is licensed under the GPLv3.  Please send bug reports and
feature suggestions to me via e-mail <mats@sjoberg.fi> or to my
pump.io account [sazius@io.saz.im](https://io.saz.im/sazius).

Oh, and "pumpa" just means pumpkin in Swedish :-)


## Build dependencies
  
Pumpa should build with Qt 4.8 or Qt 5.0 or newer. If you are using Qt
4, you will also need the QJson library.

For example on Debian 7.0 "wheezy" the following command should
install everything needed to build the code:

    aptitude install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqjson-dev

If you want spell checking install the aspell library as well:

    aptitude install libaspell-dev


## Building

To download and build, type the following:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/pumpa/pumpa.git
    cd pumpa
    qmake-qt4     # or just "qmake" on some systems
    make


## Running

Currently Pumpa doesn't have a preferences dialog so you'll have to
edit the configuration file manually.  An empty template will be
generated when you start pumpa for the first time by running:

    ./pumpa
    
You need to fill in "site_url" and "username" in the config file which
typically resides at `~/.config/pumpa/pumpa.conf`, for example:

    [Account] 
    site_url=https://microca.st/ 
    username=someguy 

You can leave the other fields empty for now.  Now Pumpa should start
and hopefully do the OAuth authentication successfully ...  :-)


## Missing features

There are a lot of missing features still.  This list contains some of
them, that I almost certainly intend to implement once I get around to
it (not necessarily in order of importance):

* Notification system for new replies!
* Viewing of minor feed
* Add a GUI preferences dialog
* Add minimise to tray icon
* Show To: and Cc: fields of notes
* Show name of source/client app of notes
* Ability to favourite posts and comments
* Add ability to see older notes/activities
* Sharing of notes
* Ability to post images
* Images posted as image notes work fine, but images included in
  `<img>` tags in regular notes do not work yet... not sure what to do
  about that...

Feel free to suggest other features, however my intention is to keep
Pumpa as simple as possible, so I might not be interested in
implementing everything.
